# Advanced Programming [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/asartori86/advanced_programming_2021.svg?branch=master&status=created)](https://app.travis-ci.com/asartori86/advanced_programming_2021.svg?branch=master&status=created)

The course aims to provide advanced knowledge of both theoretical and practical programming in C++14 and Python3, with particular regard to the principles of object-oriented programming and best practices of software development.

Syllabus:

- Introduction to C++14. You will learn the logic and the basics of C++14, the built-in data types and how to effectively use them. Best practices in programming will be addressed.
- Object orientation in C++14. The principles of Object-Oriented programming will be presented with particular attention to their implementations in C++14. Some of the most important Design Patterns will be discussed.
- Python3. After a recap of the basics of Python3, you will learn how to program in object-oriented fashion in the Python3 programming language.
- How to combine the two languages. Several methods to combine the two languages will be presented.
